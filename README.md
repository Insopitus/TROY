## Why did I start this project?

This is a project I wanted to start when I was reading *WebGL Programming Guide: Interactive 3D Graphics Programming with WebGL* - a big shoutout to Kouichi Matsuda for this awesome book.

Dunno if it's just me, but when i was learning WebGL APIs, I was like "Gosh, do I really need to call these many functions just to draw a cube? A wrap function is definitely needed."

Yes, I know there're quite a few decent open-source javascript 3D libraries, like Three.js and Babylon.js. What I'm going to do is literally reinventing the wheels. But, whatever, I just want to write my own one. It's also a good way of learning, after all.

## What do I want to achieve?

Nothing too serious. I'm not willing to write a lib as great as Threejs. That would take years of hard work. I do this just for fun. So the job right now is basic - to draw a cube with light and shading with a mouse-controled camera. New features would be added as I learn more of WebGL and get enough time.
